                <p>
                    Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam had always encouraged people to strive towards incorporating 
new values, ethics and learnings in their day-to-day lives.His contribution in the 
scientific development sector, and his devotion towards serving the nation, will forever
be remembered by one and all.Kalam always emphasized that you should never lose out on your 
humble self even if you are the head of an entire nation. No matter where life takes you,
it is essential to always remain grounded and maintain humility at all times.

                <h2>Lessons_For_Life</h2>
                <b>“You have to dream before your dreams can come true,” said A.P.J Abdul Kalam - a name that will always be remembered in our hearts! 
                He was great a source of learning and the most humble person of that stature. 
                Sadly, he is not with us anymore, however, he will always reside in our hearts.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be prepared</li>
                    <p>
                        No matter how much effort & time you have put in to achieve a goal, life does not always follow the plan we have set for ourselves.
                         There will be times when it decides to take its course and makes you follow it instead. What next? In such emergencies, 
                        it becomes essential to be prepared. And for that, you need to have the right presence of mind to decide what steps to take next to
                         ensure you fall back onto track.</p>
                    <li> Taking failures in your stride</li>
                       <p> “If you want to become unique, defeat fear and become the captain of the problem” he highlighted.
                         The best way to succeed is to take success and failure in the same stride. Both come hand in hand. If you learn to take failure in your
                         stride, you will also start looking at the solution to the problem than the cause itself.
                         Learn to treat your failures, the same way you treat success & you will be amazed to see how you master the art of succeeding.
                       </p>
                    <li> Think & act different</li>
                    <p>
                        “My message, especially to young people is to have the courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path,
                         courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed” he emphasized. In a country like ours where lakhs of students
                         are preparing & competing for that one seat in their dream college, what is the probability of you making it through them? It is your mind & thinking that makes all the difference here & not all those hours you’ve spent solving a paper! Dare to think differently & identify a technique that sets you apart from the rest.
                    </p>
                    <li> Have A Vision</li>
                    <p>
                        Vision and strategy are both important to lead a successful life. Which one comes first? Undoubtedly, vision. 
                        If you have a clear vision in mind, you will eventually adopt the right strategy. If you dont have a clear vision, no strategy will work
                         in your favour. Don't just stop there! Once you define a vision in mind, nurture it, work towards it, wait for its fruition & finally get
                         ready to reap its benefits.</p>
